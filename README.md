# CheersEmployeeDB
A mock employee database for the legendary bar 'Cheers'.

This is a project created for my PHP/SQL/DatabaseManagement course at LBCC COSW30.
The homepage can direct you to:
1. A page that lists all employees. Gives edit options.
2. A page that lists all departments. Gives edit options.
3. An employee registration page.
4. A department registration page.
5. A page where management can upload and store images.
